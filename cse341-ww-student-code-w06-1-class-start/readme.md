# Lesson 11 Class Activity Starting Code

The purpose of this activity is to help students practice writing tests for their Node.js projects.

## Steps to Complete

### Setup

- Look through the sample code and get familiar with it
- Run npm install to install dependencies.
- Create a .env file and add a your own mongodb connection string: ` MONGODB_URI=<your connection string here>`
- Install jest with `npm install --save-dev jest`
- Install supertest with `npm install --save-dev supertest`. This adds some extra functionality for testing API calls.
- Add the following line to the scripts section of your package.json:`"test": "jest --watch --coverage"`
  The jest command runs your test scripts. The --watch option will have your tests rerun every time you make a code change. The --coverage option will show how much of your code has been tested.
- The \_\_tests\_\_ folder is where you will add your test files

### Route Tests

- Write tests for the /users GET and POST routes.
- You can put these in the same file, or in two different files. The file name should end in ".spec.js" (e.g. routes.spec.js)
- Your tests should at least test for the correct response status codes and content types.
- [This tutorial](https://fek.io/blog/how-to-add-unit-testing-to-express-using-jest) has an example of what that could look like
- Also take a look at the docs for [jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [supertest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest)
- When you are finished, compare your solution with the get.spec.js and post.spec.js files in the sample solution.
